                    Carter's fashion style is one of the main features of his public image. GQ has defined Carter as the "leader of a youth style", and said that he represents a stylistic midpoint between the "fashion gloss of A$AP Mob, the punk-rock attitude of Uzi Vert, and the playful camp of Yachty."

                    Carter's favorite designer is Raf Simons and favorite designer label is Balmain. Carter met Simons at a fashion show in New York City.[36] Carter is featured on the song "RAF" by A$AP Mob, which was dedicated to Raf Simons. The music video for the song included Carter, A$AP Rocky, and Quavo wearing rare Raf Simons-designed clothing.Carter considers Kanye West and A$AP Rocky inspirations for his fashion style.

                Playboi Carti has started adjusting his wardrobe in order to fit the theme of his current or upcoming music.
                During his 2020 album rollout of <span style="color:red">"Whole Lotta Red"</span>, Carti centered his fashion 
                around dark imagery and evil silhouettes. And this is fitting, as the album had a reoccuring vampire theme.  
                Similarly, his 2018 album, "Die Lit" was centered around a punk reference, so he included this into his outfits of the time.
                Carti uses his clothes not only as self-expression, but also as a marketing ploy for his upcoming music.
