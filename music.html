                    Playboi Carti has been described as a "mumble rapper", and his music as "playful, hard-hitting, and very melodic." Complex called his style of rapping "spare and repetitive, more concerned with flow and catchy phrases." Briana Younger at Pitchfork said that "Carti’s music is less about lyricism and more about atmosphere", going on to say that "whatever Carti lacks in substance he makes up in sheer audacity."

                    Carter is known for his "baby voice" technique, characterized by his voice hitting high pitches with unclear pronunciations and frantic cadences. He has used this technique on popular songs such as "Almeda" with Solange, "Earfquake" with Tyler, the Creator, and "Pissy Pamper" with Young Nudy and Pi'erre Bourne.

                    The New York Times said Carti's rapping made it appear as if he was "more at ease with the performance of the role than with the actual act of rapping."

                    His style is influenced by vampire movies. Lil Wayne inspired him to freestyle all of his raps. (Wikipedia)

                Regarding his most recent album titled <span style="color:red">"Whole Lotta Red"</span>, Pitchfork says, 
                "The Atlanta rapper’s third record is both wildly innovative and strikingly consistent. 
                It’s hard, melodic, experimental, and unlike anything else happening in mainstream rap.""
